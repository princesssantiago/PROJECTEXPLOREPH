            <h1>"Why do I love the Philippines"</h1>
            <h2>by Greg Bloom, Writer</h2>

            <p>With 7000 tropical islands on my doorstep, all ripe for exploration,
              I find it easy to like the Philippines. Love, on the other hand,
              is borne of subtler things. Love is borne of long rooftop jeepney rides
              through the mountains of North Luzon; of a frosty San Miguel at sundown
              on a sublime slab of Visayan sand; of a fresh-fish lunch, followed by a
              siesta on an interminable bangka journey through Palawan's islands;
              of friends with names like Bing and Bong; of phrases like 'comfort room';
              of – dare I say it – karaoke. Now that is love.</p>

            <h3>Tempestuous Tropics</h3>

            <p>We've all had it happen: your trip to paradise is ruined by day after day
              of torrential monsoon rain (in the Philippines that paradise is often Palawan).
              There are a couple of simple ways to avoid this. One, study the climate charts.
              The western parts of the the country get hammered by rain at the peak of the
              southwest monsoon (July to September), so go east during this time
              (unless there's a typhoon brewing). Two, stay flexible. Dispense with advance
              bookings so you can migrate to fairer climes if need be.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Cultural Quirks</h3>

            <p>The Philippines is a land apart from mainland Southeast Asia – not only
              geographically but also spiritually and culturally. The country’s overwhelming
              Catholicism, the result of 350 years of Spanish rule, is its most obvious enigma.
              Vestiges of the Spanish era include exuberant town fiestas (festivals), unique
              Spanish-Filipino colonial architecture and centuries-old stone churches. Malls,
              fast-food chains and widespread spoken English betray the influence of Spain’s
              colonial successor, the Americans. Yet despite these outside influences, the country
              remains very much its own unique entity. The people are, simply, Filipinos – and
              proud of it. Welcoming, warm and relentlessly upbeat, it is they who captivate and
              ultimately ensnare visitors.</p>

            <h3>Outdoor Life</h3>

            <p>The Philippines isn’t just about finding an isolated beach and getting catatonic.
              From kayaking to kiteboarding to canyoning to spelunking, the Philippines can capably
              raise any adrenaline junkie’s pulse. While surfers are just catching on to the tasty
              (if fickle) waves that form on both coasts, divers have long been enamoured of the
              country’s underwater charms. Freshwater pursuits include rafting and wakeboarding.
              Back on terra firma, trekking can be done just about anywhere, while rock climbing
              is gaining popularity. And the Philippines is also, unofficially, the zipline capital
              of the world.</p>
